  "summary": "The implementation provides a comprehensive stock market education website with three difficulty levels (Beginner, Intermediate, Advanced), organized content, glossary, quick reference guides, and responsive design. Most requirements are fulfilled, but there are notable gaps in tutorial implementation and search functionality.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-5",
      "requirement": "Create a searchable glossary of stock market terms accessible from all pages, with clear definitions and examples for each term",
      "reason": "While a glossary page exists with comprehensive terms, definitions, and examples (frontend/src/data/glossaryTerms.ts, frontend/src/pages/GlossaryPage.tsx), there is no evidence of search functionality implementation in the diff. The requirement explicitly states 'searchable glossary' and 'Search functionality allows users to quickly find term definitions', but no search input, filter logic, or search feature is visible in the truncated GlossaryPage code or glossary components.",

      "requirement": "Implement step-by-step tutorials and lessons throughout each difficulty level section, with clear progression from one concept to the next",
      "reason": "While Tutorial component exists (frontend/src/components/education/Tutorial.tsx) with prerequisites and objectives, the content data files show limited tutorial implementation. Beginner content is truncated but shows mostly lessons, not tutorials. Intermediate and Advanced pages show tutorials tabs and filtering for tutorials, but the actual tutorial content in the data files appears minimal or incomplete. The requirement specifies tutorials 'throughout each difficulty level section' with 'clear progression', but evidence suggests incomplete implementation across all three levels.",

      "reason": "Quick reference component exists (frontend/src/components/reference/QuickReferenceCard.tsx) with print functionality, but the requirement states reference materials should be 'downloadable or printable'. Only print functionality is implemented via window.print(). No download functionality (e.g., PDF export, CSV download) is evident in the implementation.",
